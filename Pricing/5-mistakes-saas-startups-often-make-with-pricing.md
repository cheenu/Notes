1. Pricing should be very predictable, customer should be able to easily estimate (in less than 15 seconds) how much she'll spend in a month. 
2. Have an annual plan as soon as possible. Preferably from Day 1.
3. Increase the price of the product as the demand for the product increase i.e. it becomes more well known and develops a brand.
4. Account for the fact that procurement teams generally are compensated on their success in negoitating lower prices. 
5. Customers will never tell what exactly they are truly willing to pay since their have an economic incentive against stating their maximum price.
